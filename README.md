# Markov

Simple project demonstrating an implementation of Markov chains.
A Markov chain is a probabilistic state machine; if you tell it where you are,
it will tell you where you might go.

This is a general idea which can be used (for example) for predictive text.
This is what is used in Reddit's r/subredditsimulator.

I have trained it to generate texts my wife might send.

This project was built using stack:
- to build: stack build
- to run: stack exec Markov
