# Markov

A previously-simple project demonstrating an implementation of Markov chains.
A Markov chain is a probabilistic state machine; if you tell it where you are,
it will tell you where you might go.

This is a general idea which can be used (for example) for predictive text.
This is what is used in Reddit's r/subredditsimulator.

Exists as a slack bot (WIP, instructions to come).
